## Section 1 Reflection

1. Regarding the blog posts in Part A, how do you feel about asking questions? Do you tend to ask them too soon, or wait too long, or somewhere in between?

I always wait too long, hoping someone else will ask them! I am trying to work on speaking up more in the moment, but I always feel like if I miss the exact right moment, that I will be disrupting the entire flow of the class. I have included this in my intentions before each session starts, to try and speak up more.

2. What are the data types you learned about in this section? In your own words, define each.

 a. Numbers: Can be any standard number, decimal, or negative number. No commas or fractions.

 b. String: Any combination of letters, words or phrases contained in quotation marks.

 c. Booleans: A true or false statement.

3. How would you log the string `"Hello World!"` to the console?

`console.log("Hello World!");`

4. What is/are the character(s) you would use to indicate comments in a JavaScript file? What is the purpose of a code comment?

For a single line comment, use `// before each line`

For a multi-line comment, use `/* *comment goes here* */`
The purpose of code comments are to include any useful information, or relevant notes that you would like to keep only in the working file and not be logged.

5. In your own words, what is a variable? How would you explain it to a 5 year old?

A variable is similar to a container that can hold different items. For instance, when your parent packs your lunch for school, they might store grapes in a ziplock bag. In this case, the ziplock bag would be the variable and the grapes would be the data that may change day to day. Some days you might get packed oranges in your ziplock bag, or apple slices. The ziplock can change based on what is in it.

6. Think of a site or app you use frequently. What are three variables that are probably used? Which data type would each of those variables probably hold?

Google maps. Two variables would be the start and end destination that the user types in. These would both be a string. Another variable would be the number of miles it calculates for your route which would be a number. A possible boolean variable is when it asks if you would like to avoid toll roads and you have to check or uncheck the box.

7. In your own words, explain what concatenation is.

When you have multiple strings of data, you can log them as a single string by using the + sign to combine them.

8. Think of a site or app you use frequently. Where do you think the developers used concatenation?

On Instagram when you comment on someone's photo, it is stringing together the variable of your name as well as your string of comment.

9. What questions do you still have about the work we've done so far? (not having a question is not an option)

I am still not clear on the difference between github gist and github.
