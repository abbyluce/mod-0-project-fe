## Section 2 Reflection

1. What are two points from the Growth Mindset article and/or video that either resonated with you, or were brand new to you?

Focusing on the process really resonated for me from both the article and video. The article mentioned taking time to refine and reflect, the video interview mentioned making sure to look back at your own personal progress from where you started instead of comparing yourself to others.

I also resonated with the idea that asking for help is actually a sign of strength, not weakness. It shows vulnerability, can save time, and can also help others in the learning process.

2. In which ways do you currently demonstrate a Growth Mindset? In which ways do you _not_?

I feel like I am skilled at taking time to set intentions and for reflection. I think that this is important for any aspect of life, not just school or work. I journal and meditate frequently, and like to stay organized with my time. Being intentional with my time and making sure I enjoy the process of learning new skills again has been important to me, rather than just making sure I always get the correct answer. I also really do believe that practice and effort are going to help carry me through my time at Turing. I have been taking time to review and practice lessons learned during each session.

One way in which I do not demonstrate a Growth Mindset would be my inclination to compare myself to others. During my Interior Design undergrad, it always felt like a competition between me and the other students. It was not a healthy learning environment, and I left the program feeling incredibly insecure because of the constant comparison. I do feel like starting fresh in a new career I can choose to have a different mindset going into it, especially now that I really believe in my capabilities to learn something new.

3. In this section, we removed some of the supports that you had in Section 1. We didn't give the directions for how to run a file in node and made some directions a bit more vague, intentionally. How did that feel? What was uncomfortable about it? How did it support your learning?

I honestly didn't even notice until this reflection! I feel like I have had a lot of practice up to this point on double checking my work in the terminal, and I am already getting more comfortable with googling or checking slack if I get stuck. It is a great feeling to realize how far I have come in just one week.

4. What is a conditional statement? Give one example of a daily life conditional. Give one example of where a conditional is probably used in a web application you use.

A conditional statement says what to do in a given situation based off of how certain variables change. For instance, if my husband walks the dog in the morning, I will be the one to walk him in the evening. If he doesn't walk him, I will take him out first thing. The changing variable being whether or not my husband walked the dog already, and the conditional being when I will walk the dog.

An easy example to think of is when I am trying to login to a website, for instance, my bank. If my password is correct, it will proceed to my account page, if I forget my password, which I often do, it will ask me to try again or ask if I have forgotton my password.

5. How do you add multiple conditions to an `if` statement? In your own words, explain how to program reads them and determines what to do.

You can add multiple conditions to an `if` statement by using `else if` statements. Each `else if` statement can list a specific condition. These statements are run in order, if the first condition is true, the subsequent instructions will be run and the rest will be ignored. Only one section of code can run per condition.  

6. What tools are available to you, as a developer, if you want to check that TWO conditions are met? Or, if you want to check that 1 of 2 conditions are met, before running a block of code?

You can use a logical operator to check multiple conditions. The code `&&` will check if both conditions are true, the code `||` will check if one of the two conditions are true.

7. What questions do you still have about `if` statements and/or functions?

Is there any situation where you would use the `==` sign?
