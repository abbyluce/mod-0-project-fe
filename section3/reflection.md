## Section 3 Reflection

1. In Section 3, we removed even more supports and pushed you to learn a bit more independently, read through technical documentation, and use your resources more. How did that feel?

I felt comfortable with this. I have taken really good notes and definitely referenced earlier sections quite a bit. Between that and a few google searches, I felt comfortable with the tasks at hand.

2. Think of a web or mobile application you use regularly. Where is an example of a place that the developers probably use Arrays? Explain.

When online shopping, I think there are quite a few arrays involved. For instance on zara.com (or any online shop), you can refine your search to show something specific like "women's dresses", and then keep refining by size, color, etc. The array would be the catalog of options, and the different variables within it are the specific styles. Or if you are looking at a specific dress, the size options of that dress would make up the array.

3. In your own words, explain what an Array method is.

Array methods are essentially shortcuts that can either tweak the values within an array or run certain functions off of the values.  

4. What is the purpose of a loop? When we would use a loop in conjunction with array vs. without?

If you would like to run the same action multiple times, a loop is a shortcut that simplifies this process vs writing multiples of the same line of code.

If you have an array of values, a `for` loop will run the same code against either all or the specified values in the array. You would use this if you needed to evaluate each value in a variable against a specific condition.

If you wanted to run the same code multiple times without an array, this is called a `while` or `do...while` loop. It will either run the code against the specified condition until the condition logs `false` or it will run all conditions even if they return false.

5. If you had to teach a 5 year old about loops, how would you explain it?

Think of a loop like the camera taking pictures of the riders at splash mountain, every time a log boat comes rowing through the ride and down the big hill, the camera goes, 'click!' and takes a photo, and you can see all of the riders shocked faces! Once the log boats stop going through the ride, the camera stops taking pictures.

6. What questions do you still have about Arrays and loops?

I am having a hard time thinking of a specific example that you would use `while` or `do...while` loops, I think if this was explained in more everyday terms it would make a little more sense!
